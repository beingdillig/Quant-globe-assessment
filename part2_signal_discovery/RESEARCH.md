## ✅ Why I Chose GPT-4.1 for This Project

- GPT-4.1 understands financial trades better — it can read structured data (like trade logs) and give smart summaries.
- It gives clear, accurate insights about risks, performance, and signals.
- It works smoothly with LangGraph, which I used to build the agent workflow.
- I'm comfortable using GPT-4.1 and know how to get the best results from it — especially for smart analysis and building LLM agents.

👉 **So, I feel GPT-4.1 is the best choice to build a strong and smart Signal Extraction Agent.**
